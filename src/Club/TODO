== BOOKING BUNDLE ==
enable and disable teams
enable and disable bookings
enable and disable events
dont bind bookings to interval, make them as schedules
on visit shop with no categories, view shops with products
on visit to booking with no fields, view locations with fields
change password
add news blog on welcome page

== NOTES TO LATER ==
add display username
make sure widgets works:
  - datetime
  - date
  - time
add address on club to api
login through booking page
login through team attend page
jquery overlay form on booking
implement payment for booking
make sure that not 2 intervals can be valid at the same time
fix num_team_day
find a smart way to get default location, might be with the url
add booking plans
  - maintenance
  - cleaning
  - tournament
use validators in coupon
bind coupon to specific product
move all login pages to /user
not 2 schedules can have the same interval
what will happen if interval access multiple days
dynamic number of partners for a booking
booking module should work without partners too
much better debugging on errors from API.. make sure all errors is wrapped in encode->encodeError()
what happens if you put schema on already booked interval
booking admins should be able to deleted planned schedules too
something is broken when creating more intervals on the same field, fix it
on admin interval manager, put a default interval in top, that will set the same for everyone
when field created, forward to create interval page
on switch location, stay on last visited page
